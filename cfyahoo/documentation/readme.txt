If you find this code worthy, I have a Amazon wish list set up (www.amazon.com/o/registry/2TCL1D08EZEYE ). Gifts are always welcome. ;)

IMPORTANT NOTICE

This is the beginning of an updated version of the CFYahoo package. Many of the APIs have changed and I'm beginning the process of updating
the code. I'm detailing what I know SHOULD work. Anything NOT listed here is NOT gauranteed to work now. The archived folder contains the 1.0
version of the CFCs. The CFCs in ORG now are the ones that are in progress.

As for September 24, I've updated

search.cfc
weather.cfc

to support the latest APIs. The weather API did not change, but the URL was updated. The search API had massive updates, including new arguments
and results. Please look at the method hint arguments for details. 

Also note that base.cfc was updated to include my Application ID. I believe this is ok with Yahoo, but if I'm wrong, I'll be removing it.
